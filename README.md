# Spotify auto pauser
## What and Why?
I got tired of pausing Spotify every time I walked away from my computer
and then unpausing it when I got back so I wrote a quick little tool to do it
for me since I always lock/unlock my computer.

That's just about all it does right now.

There's also a tray icon that provides a one-click play/pause.

## Usage
Download the EXE file and put it somewhere it can stay, e.g. your home directory or program files. Run it.
You can make it start automatically by right-clicking the tray icon and checking "Launch on boot".

While it's running, any time you lock your computer Spotify will pause and then resume when you unlock it.

There will also be a ||> icon in your system tray. You can left click it to do a quick pause/play.

If you right click, you'll see an option to launch it on startup and a button to quit.

## History
- The project was originally at code.google.com/p/spotify-auto-pauser
- Forked from jucrouzet to fix some issues
